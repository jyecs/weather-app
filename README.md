# weather-app

Overall a pretty nice refresser on APIs. I know that I exposed my key, it's all good to be honest.
I couldn't get dotenv to work to try to hide my key a bit more, not entirely sure why it didn't work
to be honest.

I only did a light amout of CSS, and I couldn't get this enter submission to work, maybe I will fix it
once I figure out exactly what event is triggering it. The only thing that really bothers me
is that it will only work if you hit the actual button.

I also tried to use some other classes this time, but there really wasn't that much to do
in that department either. Code overall bulky looking.
